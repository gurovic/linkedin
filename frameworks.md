* Handles most of the backend and frontend stuff  
* Easy to use

### eJS

* Not sure if necessary but pretty convenient

* More low-level but still makes everything much much easier  
* Can be used with both eJS and React

## Bootstrap

* for css, beautiful and versatile  
* a bit dated design but whatever

* powerful
